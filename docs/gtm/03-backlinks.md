# 03-backlinks.md - Domain Authority

<!--
PROMPT: Backlinks build domain authority over time. Ask me:

1. What's your current domain authority? (Check with Ahrefs, Moz, or Semrush - "new" if just launched)

2. Do you have any existing relationships that could link to you?
   - Partner companies
   - Industry associations
   - Podcast hosts you've appeared on
   - Tools/services you use that have directories

3. What's your competitive advantage? (What makes you worth linking to?)
   - Unique data/research
   - Free tools
   - Thought leadership
   - Open source projects

4. How much time can you dedicate to link building?
   - 1 hour/week (minimal)
   - 5 hours/week (moderate)
   - 10+ hours/week (aggressive)

This is an ongoing effort, not a one-time setup.

## What This Does

Backlinks = other sites linking to yours. More quality backlinks = higher domain authority = better rankings.

**Important**: This is a long-term strategy. Results take months.
