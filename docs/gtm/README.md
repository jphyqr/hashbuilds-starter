HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER:

GTM (Go-To-Market) strategies for getting discovered. Set these up AFTER your MVP works.

**The order:**
1. 01-long-tail-seo.md → Auto-generate SEO articles (1/day)
2. 02-json-ld.md → Get found by ChatGPT/Perplexity
3. 03-backlinks.md → Build authority

**When to do this:**
- MVP is functional and deployed
- You have business context filled out (02-business-context.md)
- You're ready to focus on traffic/growth
