3. What problem are you solving? (The core pain point)
4. How do you solve it? (Your solution in 2-3 sentences)
5. What's your business model? (How do you make money?)
6. What's your north star metric? (The ONE number that matters most)
7. What's your vision? (The world you're trying to create - aspirational)

9. Who are your competitors? (List 2-3, including "status quo")
10. What's your unfair advantage? (Why you win against each competitor)
